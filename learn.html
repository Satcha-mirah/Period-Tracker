        <div class="tab-contents active-tab" id="Menstrual Cycle">
            <p> The menstrual cycle is a term to describe the sequence of events that occur in your body as it prepares for the possibility of pregnancy each month.<br> 
            This is when you shed the lining of your uterus.<br>
            This cycle is part of your reproductive system and prepares your body for a possible pregnancy.<br>
            A typical cycle lasts between 24 and 38 days.
            Your menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of your menstrual period until the first day of your next menstrual period.<br>
            Every person‚Äôs cycle is slightly different, but the process is the same.
            Most people have their period (bleed) for between three and seven days.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-contents active-tab" id="Menstrual Hygeine">
            <p>Good menstrual health and hygiene practices can prevent infections,<br>
            reduce odors and help you stay comfortable during your period.<br>
             You can choose many types of menstrual products to absorb or collect blood during your period,<br>
            including sanitary pads, tampons, menstrual cups, menstrual discs, and period underwear.</p>
        </div>

        
            <div class="tab-contents active-tab" id="Ovulation">
                <p>Ovulation is a phase in the menstrual cycle when your ovary releases an egg (ovum).<br> 
                Once an egg leaves your ovary, it travels down your fallopian tube where it waits to be fertilized by sperm.<br>
                On average, it happens on day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle.<br>
                In an average 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation occurs about 14 days before the beginning of your next menstrual period.<br>
                The exact timing varies ‚Äî your cycle length may be longer or shorter.<br>
                You may find it helpful to track your menstrual cycle using an app on your phone or a calendar.<br>
                This can help you determine when ovulation is most likely to occur. <br>
                Most people will have a period 14 to 16 days after ovulation, regardless of the length of their overall cycle.
            </p>

        <div class="tab-contents active-tab" id="Safe Periods">
            <p>It is when supposedly a woman has the least chance of getting pregnant. Women go through monthly changes in their bodies in the name of the menstrual cycle.<br>
                A monthly cycle has two components:<br>
                Proliferating Phase: This is the period that begins soon after the menstrual bleeding starts.<br>
                Secretory Phase: This is a constant period of 14 days, which you can count as 14 days before you get your periods.<br>
                By no means, it provides complete protection against pregnancy since it has been seen that the intercourse itself may trigger untimely ovulation.<br>
                You can easily use our safe day's calculator to find out the safe days in your cycle for this month.<br>
                Safe days can be calculated by counting the number of days of your periods for six months continuously.<br>
                With the help of the record, count the days of your longest menstrual cycle and subtract 18 days.<br> 
                Count that number of days from the first day of your last period, and mark it as M.<br>
                Subtract 10 days from your shortest menstrual cycle, and count that number of days from the first day of your last period and mark it as N.<br>
                The days between M and N are the most fertile days, and the other days are considered as safe days.
